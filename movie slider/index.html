            Ethan Hunt and the IMF team must track down a terrifying new weapon
            that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands.
            With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, a
            deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious,
            all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can
            matter more than the mission -- not even the lives of those he cares
            about most.

          <h1 class="title">Ted</h1>
          <p class="desc">
            By 1993, Ted the foul-mouthed teddy bear's moment of fame has
            passed. He's moved back in with his best friend, likable but awkward
            16-year-old John Bennett, who lives in a working-class Boston home
            with his parents, Matty and Susan, and cousin Blaire. Matty's a
            blustering, blue-collar Bostonian who thinks he's the unequivocal
            boss of the house and doesn't like anyone challenging him,
            particularly his liberal-minded niece. Susan is kind, selfless and
            almost pathologically sweet when it comes to caring for her family.
            Blaire is a smart and politically correct college student who's not
            afraid to speak her mind and frequently clashes with her more
            traditionalist family.
